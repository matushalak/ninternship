 2025 MSc. Neuroscience Internship with Dr. Huub Terra in Levelt Lab at Netherlands Institute of Neuroscience


`src` contains most important source-code for most analyses
`2Paligner` contains image registration project to Align widefield and much smaller and different 2-photon images
`MODEL` contains code for the CadEX model developed to be fit to 2-photon calcium imaging data

Intended workflow is to cd INSIDE the repository and call functions like `python -m src.VisualAreas` to run `src/VisualAreas.py`.
